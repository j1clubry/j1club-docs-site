Chairperson can contact all the J1 members to find the interested members and can also regularly send notifications about the events. Upon having committment from the members, chairperson submits the request to the 'J1 Club Ry Board' for a recurring event booking in appropriate location.

Once the board approves the request and a booking is secured, the committee executives can then plan for the events.

#### Responsibilities

Chairperson and other executives of the sports committee have full responsibility of the securing the keys to the location, sports equipments, and all the facilities included in the premises. It is also mandatory for anyone of the executives to be present during the event. In event of non-availability, the keys or access to the location can be shared with a member but the chairperson and other executives share the overall responsibility.

All members/participants are required to follow the basic etiquettes and any special rules set by the committee. Depending upon the ease-of-use, the executives of the committee can decide to use either Suomisports or WhatsApp or Signal for the communication amoung the group.

### Planning for a Tournament

Chairperson or other executives of the committee can send a formal request to the Board, for planning and conducting a tournament. Board members (all) will work with the committee executives, analysing the interest shown, location availability, time and duration of the tournament, tournament fees (as applicable). Board members will have a exclusive meeting to discuss on the approval for conducting tournament. Once a majority (no voting, but just oral/written approval) is secured in favour of conducting the tournament, the information is then communicated to the sports committee executives.
